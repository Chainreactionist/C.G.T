**C.G.T** -  is a game template that aims to simplify the game prototyping and development process by providing a standardized development environment. C.G.T provides you with all the essential tools you would need to start a new project and prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot by spending time on the non-prototyping-related parts of the project.
